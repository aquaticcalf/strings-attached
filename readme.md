## strings attached

### why? ( the external question )

you might ask, "why another string manipulation library?"

and in that question lies the beautiful absurdity of our craft. 

just as sisyphus was destined to roll his boulder up the hill for eternity,

we developers are bound to keep creating new string utilities,

each time convinced that *this* time we'll get it right.
